# new_website

My new web portal website address is https://qiqi789.netlify.com, which is hosted at Netlify.com, and generated by Hugo. It was created in RStudio as a new directory project of website with blogdown. It can be edited within RStudio, and live reviewing by typing blogdown::serve_site() in console. When clicking the "show in new window" in viewer, it will open a local review page in a browser.
